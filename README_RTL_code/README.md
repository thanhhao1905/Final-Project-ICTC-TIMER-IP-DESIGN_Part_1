# Final-Project-ICTC _ TIMER-IP-DESIGN
The timer module features a high-resolution 64-bit counter supporting both free-running and periodic modes. A configurable prescaler allows flexible timing from high-frequency to long-duration applications, while the integrated APB interface ensures easy integration with ARM-based systems and complex digital designs.
